# Summation of Primes - Problem 10

## Step 1: Get Primes

Given a number from 2 to 1 million, find the number of primes that exist that are contained by one and that number.

For example, the number of prime numbers that exist less than 100 are 25:

`2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97`

## Step 2: Get the Summation of Primes

Given a number from 2 to 2 million, return the sum of all the primes that exist less than said number.

For example, there are 10 primes less than the number 30:

`2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29`

The sum of these numbers is 129.
